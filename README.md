# Irish public holidays

This repo contains [iCalendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar) files marking public holidays in Ireland. Information is taken from [Citizens Information](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/leave-and-holidays/public-holidays/). Good Friday is included though it is not technically a public holiday.
